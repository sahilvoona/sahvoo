                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>At SahilProductions, we strive to help people who are currently unemployed, or people who would like to share their work experience with others.  </p>
                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <ul>Here is how it works. It is very easy to use the format for the website created by SahilProdcutions.</ul>
                    <ul>First, press "view source" of the example website, Ben the Dentist.</ul>
                    <ul>You will also need VS Code, GitHub Desktop, and a Github account.</ul>
                    <ul>The goal is to customize an example website for user purposes. The user can edit the images, links, and content to their customization.</ul>
                    <ul>This can be done by replacing the links in the code of the website, and uploading it to GitHub, which will allow others to view the website.</ul> 
                    <ul>This service is completely free, so please use it for your own benefit.</ul>
