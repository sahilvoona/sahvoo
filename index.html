                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <p> Here is how it works. It is very easy to use the format for the website created by SahilProdcutions. First, press "view source" of the example website, Ben the Dentist. You will also need VS Code, GitHub Desktop, and a Github account. The goal is to customize the example website for the user purposes. The user can edit the images, links, and content to their customization. This can be done by replacing the links in the code of the websote, and uploading it to GitHub, which will allow others to view the website. This service is completely free, so please use it for your own benefit. </p>
